## Bill of Materials

This build only costs about $82.19 CAD. Prices vary and you might need to watch for discounts to pop up or try searching for the same item from other sellers. Some items on Ali Express will go on sale as "choice" items, this usually means they are steeply discounted when you buy 3 or more items from the current selection in "choice".
