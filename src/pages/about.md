## What It Is

A community operated mesh radio network intended to provide back-up or even daily text communications, all using small inexpensive hardware. At this time all Salish Mesh infrastructure operates entirely on solar power.

You can checkout our friends over at [PugetMesh](https://pugetmesh.org/), we have a link to their mesh which really makes us one big family.

The mesh operates on [MeshCore](https://meshcore.co.uk/) firmware.

## What It Isn't

A replacement for the internet, cellphones or satellite emergency communications.
