## Mesh Coverage Map

This interactive map show the theoretical coverage of current Salish Mesh repeaters. To see all publicly listed repeaters, room servers and clients please visit [the MeshCore Internet Map](https://meshcore.co.uk/map.html). We also had an active link to the [Puget Mesh](https://pugetmesh.org/meshcore/) MeshCore network which will be restored along with major coverage for southern vancouver island by the end of the month.

## Assumptions

The coverage simulations make a few assumptions to help create a more realistic view of the mesh. In order to expect the shown signal quality, the devices joining the mesh are assumed to be at least 2 m above ground level at that point, and to have a quality antenna of at least 1.2 dBi gain.

## Repeaters

Information on repeaters that play an important role in the mesh, whose operators have chosen
to share details about.

## Help Improve Coverage

There are a few ways to help improve coverage: either setting up a repeater or just reporting areas of spotty coverage or other areas you would like to see coverage expand to. If you want to add a repeater you can either set up your own on your roof, or in a tree for example. Or you can [reach out](/about#reach-out) to work together and setup a well placed repeater that we can add to the official list.
